    <h2>What is SuperHero TESTING123?</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>A <b>superhero</b> (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
        or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.
        A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the
        word superhero is commonly used for females also. <a href="http://www.google.com"> Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s.</a></p>
    <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>        While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
        with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary
        gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful
        or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes
        used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless
        share similar traits.</p>

    <h3>Many superhero characters display the following traits:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>Extraordinary powers or abilities.</em> <strong>Superhero</strong> powers
            <u>vary widely</u>; superhuman strength, the ability to fly, enhanced senses, and the projection of energy bolts
            are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird, the Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman
            powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage techniques, and applied or forensic sciences
            to a highly remarkable degree. </li>
        <li>Others rely on fantastical weapons or technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring,
            and trick arrows employed by Green Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers
            with a special weapon or device (e.g. Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather
            manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's adamantium claws).
        </li>
        <li>
            A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without expectation of reward.
            Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.
        </li>

        Golden Age comic, featuring superheroes battling contemporaneous, cartoon-stereotype depictions of the three Axis
        powers leaders. Cover art by Alex Schomburg. A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man),
        an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman), a childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman),
        or a strong belief in justice and humanitarian service (e.g. Superman).
